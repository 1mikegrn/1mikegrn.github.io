							Lectured on chemistry topics for both the Saturday Academy and Summer Scholars diversity outreach programs offered through the University of Missouri School of Medicine in Kansas City, MO. For Saturday Academy, responsibilities consisted of designing and presenting chemistry lectures over the weekends to enrolled middle and high school students from the Kansas City area who had the desire to obtain more exposure to math and science in their pre-collegiate education. Topics covered therein included General Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Physical Chemistry. The summer scholars outreach program consisted of an intensive two-week lecture series for Kansas City area high school seniors, focusing on Organic Chemistry fundamentals, Organic Chemistry Reactions, and Biochemistry.

						<h3>Teaching</h3>
						<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">
							I believe that potential is infinite. When it comes to my students, it doesn't matter where they come from, what class they were born into, what privilege they have or they lack. The goal is growth, plain and simple. And as a teacher, it's my job to be sure that not only are my students proficient in the material they are tasked to cover, but that they strive for the greatest of growth which they can manage. For some, growth is second nature. And for those students, the responsibility is to be sure that the requisite assistance and material is available for them to strive. For others, sometimes growth takes a bit of work. For these students, the responsibility I assume as their mentor is to go beyond the call of duty, and to work unremittingly with those who require the extra effort. This dichotomy I find is the great challenge when it comes to education: maintaining the standard that every individual student has an equality of opportunity for success, but recognizing the truth that support should be dispropotionally allocated towards those who most need it. It is particularly difficult at the undergraduate level, when for these college students, so much of their path has already been defined. Nevertheless, our job as educators isn't to shy away from challenges which we find difficult. It is simply to see the situation as it is, and how from such, work so that the best of everyone shines through. As President Roosevelt said, "credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena... who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly..." This vision of daring greatly is the vision I too have developed through my years in the classroom; starting from being the one to whom growth took a bit of work, to now having been the instructor at the head of the lecture hall. And through my experience in the years which I have been studying and teaching, I've come to truly believe that great enthusiasms and great devotions, coupled with logical and intelligent approach, do bring forth the goals which we so dare greatly to realize.
							<br><br>
							When it comes to realizing this goal for growth in the classroom, I like do draw on my experience both as a student of chemistry, as well as a student of programming. One of the core tennants of the Python programming language is 'explicit is better than implicit.' And some of the best chemistry professors who I have studied under, such as Dr. Eric Brauns at the University of Idaho and Dr. Charles Wurrey at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, have all managed to adhere to this ideal in their teaching - I aspire to do the same. This means not leaving room for guesswork in lecture material. Full derivations, full context, and A depth-first approach to content. If necessary to choose, I would rather teach students <i>how</i> truth is derived, not <i>what</i> truth is. Only one of these models scales beyond the classroom, and our job as educators is to prepare students for life beyond university education.
							<br><br>
							Finally, there's something to be said about conducting yourself in a manner which is beyond mere content. I don't see teaching as a seminar setting where there's the person at the front who knows the material, and the task is to regurgitate the information to those who don't. There's more nuance to it than that. It's more of a discussion, more a dialogue, between the teacher and the individual students. It's more of an art than a science. From my experience as a student, the best teachers have always been able to convey their content at a level beyond mere information transfer. Granted, there's a certain <i>Je Ne Sais Quoi</i> to it - I can't exactly describe it. But, I know what it is. I've seen it. Experienced it. And I do my best to teach it.

							The world of tomorrow is technological. It's undeniable that the workforce of the next generation will require the skills necessary to leverage this power of technology, so to drive innovation and discovery for the 21st century economy. This is particularly true in the field of chemistry, where entire fields of computational chemistry, materials informatics, physical and analytical chemistry, and even organic chemistry, which are now inextricably intertwined with computer science. As such, it is imperative that students be trained in the 21st century data-driven methods which undergird the foundation of research tomorrow.

						<p style="font-size:20px" align="justify">
							As members of a community, I wholeheartedly believe that it is our responsibility to be active proponents for education at all stages of individual development. This is why for the first three years of my PhD work, I worked with the School of Medicine to teach the chemistry portions of their diversity outreach programs. It was an amazing opportunity to work with these middle and high school level kids who were so passionate about taking every opportunity to grow. Working with these students, showing them the chemistry of the life inside us and the world around us, was a pleasure and an honor.
